# Bioinformatics Analysis Pipeline

This project provides a bioinformatics analysis pipeline for performing various statistical and postprocessing tasks on biological sequence data. It includes several subdirectories with different modules for specific tasks.

## Subdirectories

- **download_sequences**: Contains scripts for downloading biological sequences from public databases.
- **protein_sequences**: Includes scripts for processing and analyzing protein sequences.
- **seq_align**: Provides tools for sequence alignment and related analyses.
- **utils**: Contains utility functions and helper modules used across different tasks.
- **dn_ds**: Includes scripts for calculating the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) for coding sequences.
- **deseq2**: Contains scripts for performing differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2.
- **cpg_island**: Includes scripts for detecting CpG islands in DNA sequences.
- **canalized_genes**: Provides tools for analyzing canalized genes and their expression patterns.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bioinformatics-analysis-pipeline.git
```

2. Navigate to the desired subdirectory for the specific analysis task:
```
cd bioinformatics-analysis-pipeline/seq_align
```

3. Follow the instructions in each subdirectory's README file to run the corresponding analysis scripts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (specified in each subdirectory's README file)
- Internet connection for downloading external data (if applicable)
